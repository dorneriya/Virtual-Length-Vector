# Virtual Length Vector 
 A generic data structure that is adjustable in size as data is inputted and outputted.
 Switch between the stack and the heap as needed.
 
 This data structure is implemented so that it can work with the generic algorithms of The C ++ Standard Template Library,
 such as search, sort, etc.
